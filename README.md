# CraftME
An unfinished voxel game made in one week on a 20 years old laptop.
Why? Just for fun!

# Dependencies
None! I'm using opengl 1.2 (which is already included in windows) ad the win32 api.

# How to build
Once you have mingw installed and added to the system path run mingw32-make in the project folder.
Note: You may need to modify the makefile and change the location of the compiler libs and includes' directories.
